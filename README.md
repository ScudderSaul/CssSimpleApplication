# CssSimpleAplication
A css script creation tool. This tool is a modification of the CssComposition tool extension for visual studio that I wrote.
That extension is available from the visualstudio marketplace.  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SaulScudder.css3
The source for the extension is in the repository https://github.com/ScudderSaul/CssComposition
This version uses its own SqLite database rather than the one that comes with visual studio. It runs as an independent Wpf application.
There is currently at least one bug in the animation design tools.

jan 15 2025 Modified to no longer use an older visual library the change is untested.
